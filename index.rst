.. important:: In the spring of 2022, a new suite of FDEM OcTree codes were compiled: *E3DRH, E3DRH v2 and E3DRH v2 tiled*. **These codes use a right-handed coordinate system**; as opposed to the modified left-handed coordinate system used by *E3D, E3D v2 and E3D v2 tiled*. **You are currently viewing the manual for the package which uses 'e3drh.exe' to forward model and invert FDEM data**. The manual for the original E3D v1 package (which uses 'e3d.exe') `can be found here <https://e3d.readthedocs.io/en/e3d/>`__ .
