E3DRH version 2 tiled package
=============================

.. important:: In the spring of 2022, a new suite of FDEM OcTree codes were developed. These codes use a right-handed coordinate system; as opposed to a modified left-handed coordinate system. `The manual for the original E3DRH v2 tiled code can be found here <https://e3d.readthedocs.io/en/e3d/>`__ .

E3DRH version 2 tiled is a program library for carrying out forward modelling and inversion of frequency domain EM data over 3D structures. Unlike E3DRH version 2, the E3DRH version 2 'tiled' code performs the forward modeling in parallel on a set of local OcTree meshes. The contents of this manual are as follows:
